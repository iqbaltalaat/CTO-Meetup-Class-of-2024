| 29th March 2025 (Upcomping) | During the last meeting we had selected: "Mastering the Data Paradox: Key to Winning in the AI Age" as the book for this one. It was suggested by Gopal, ever the strategist within our midst. We'll have a quick discussion about this and then select our next monthly book. The next one is about shopify. Here's the abstract: "The case describes Shopify's journey from a small online store to a global technology company with an ecosystem of partners that comprised of tens of thousands of developers and partners.   From the inception of the company, Shopify's competitive advantage had come from being merchant obsessed. Having an easy to set-up and easy to use technological platform, as well as a commercial model that leveraged an ecosystem of partners, had accelerated Shopify's growth in building a merchant centric digital business. The case describes in detail the processes and drivers that had led to the success of Shopify.   However, by 2022, competitive pressure from the other forms of commerce including live streaming commerce, social commerce and commerce from super apps had started to mount. Amazon, one of the world's largest online marketplaces, had started to encroach on Shopify's market by imitating its business model. The fusion of online and offline commerce had also driven Shopify to rethink its business model and the company started to shift its focus from eCommerce to general commerce.   Shopify also wanted to penetrate the Southeast Asia (SEA) market further. High growth rates had been predicted for the region, but it was a heterogeneous market with lots of challenges including less than developed logistics infrastructure." | <ul><li>[Case Study: Building a Global Omni-channel Commerce Ecosystem: The Shopify Story](https://store.hbr.org/product/building-a-global-omni-channel-commerce-ecosystem-the-shopify-story/SMU086)</li></ul>|
| 9th Feb 2025   | "Nvidia was one of the most successful companies in the world, reaching \$3.4 trillion in valuation on June 18th, 2024. While Microsoft and Apple quickly recaptured the value crown, some analysts forecasted that Nvidia was so strongly positioned that it might become the world’s first $4 trillion company. Yet competition was beginning to emerge: AMD was offering GPUs at lower prices that were becoming more competitive with Nvidia, and many other companies had announced specialized chips that could replace Nvidia for some applications. Jockeying for Nvidia’s chips was aggressive, and split between applications including data centers, powering LLMs/AI, and more. Under these circumstances, who should get GPUs? And was monopoly pricing the best strategy? Additionally, CEO Jensen Huang had lingering questions about where Nvidia should play in the value chain. Should Huang continue to move forward with vertical integration and go head-to-head with its biggest customers, or stay a component supplier? And were there options to hedge its risk with TSMC, Nvidia’s main chip provider? <br/><br/> The book discussed was "StrategyMan vs. the Anti-Strategy Squad: Using Strategic Thinking to Defeat Bad Strategy and Save Your Plan". The book for the next one is being voted upon.

| 10th Aug 2024  | An interesting Creative Commons licensed Case Study about Sony's Battle for Video Game Supremacy in the Era of The Playstation, XBox 360 & Nintendo Wii. We'll go through a quick discussion about platforms and then delve into a quick online activity about marketplace pricing and discuss winning strategies. Looking forward to seeing everyone this Sunday.  <br/><br/> The book discussed was "Think Like a CTO" - Alan Willamson".                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | <ul><li>[Agenda & Book Selection](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14UK36YZbTsSWRQV7rHDFxYzA3PNTEgp-2GcUh8BvSqI/edit?usp=sharing)</li><li>[Case Study: Sony's Battle for Video Game Supremacy](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/sites/default/files/2024-04/Sony%27s%20Battle%20for%20Video%20Game%20Supremacy.pdf)</li><li>[Presentation - Authored through collaboration](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1prHvKXD0NRQpI9rVFwVUSEITksdqIaY303ajUfsFgW4/edit?usp=sharing)</li></ul> |
